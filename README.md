## Project Overview
The Blinkit Sales Analysis project aims to provide insights into Blinkit's sales performance by analyzing key metrics such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Customer Ratings. The project utilizes Power BI for data visualization and provides actionable insights that can help optimize sales strategies and improve overall business performance.

## Business Problem
Blinkit, a last-minute delivery app, faced challenges in understanding which factors most significantly influence sales across their various outlets. The primary business problems addressed include:
- Determining how fat content impacts total sales.
- Identifying the performance of different item types.
- Analyzing sales performance by outlet size, location, and establishment age.
- Providing a comprehensive view of key metrics across different outlet types.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes various attributes related to sales, such as:
- **Fat Content**
- **Item Type**
- **Outlet Size**
- **Outlet Location**
- **Outlet Establishment Year**
- **Total Sales**
- **Number of Items Sold**
- **Customer Ratings**

## Tools & Environment
The following tools and environments were used to develop this project:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel/MySQL**: For data storage, preprocessing, and initial exploration (if applicable).

## Steps Involved
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Understanding the key business questions and metrics.
2. **Data Walkthrough**: Reviewing the dataset to ensure completeness and accuracy.
3. **Data Connection**: Importing the dataset into Power BI.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
5. **Data Modeling**: Structuring the data by creating relationships, calculated columns, and measures.
6. **Dashboard Creation**: Designing and developing the dashboard using various chart types (Donut, Bar, Stacked Column, Line, Funnel, and Matrix).
7. **Validation & Testing**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the dashboardâ€™s insights.

## Challenges Faced
Some of the challenges encountered during this project included:
- **Data Cleaning**: Dealing with missing or inconsistent data entries.
- **Complex Data Modeling**: Creating accurate relationships between different tables and calculating KPIs.
- **Visual Representation**: Choosing appropriate chart types to effectively communicate the insights.

## Dashboard Overview
The final dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Blinkit's sales data with the following features:
- **Total Sales by Fat Content**: Donut Chart to analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
- **Sales by Item Type**: Bar Chart showing the performance of different item types.
- **Fat Content by Outlet**: Stacked Column Chart to compare total sales across outlets segmented by fat content.
- **Sales by Outlet Establishment**: Line Chart showing how outlet age influences total sales.
- **Sales by Outlet Size & Location**: Donut and Funnel Charts analyzing sales distribution by outlet size and location.
- **All Metrics by Outlet Type**: Matrix Card providing a summary of key metrics across different outlet types.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into Blinkit's sales performance, highlighting key factors influencing sales across various dimensions. The analysis can be used by Blinkit to optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions for business growth.
